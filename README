1. INSTALLATION

    You will need libusb and libftdi:
    libusb:  http://www.libusb.org/
    libftdi: http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/
    
    It has been tested on Linux 32-bit and 64-bit. 

    On Ubuntu 10.04, you can get libusb using this:
        sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libusb-0.1-4

    To build, there is an example Makefile included.
    Just type 'make'.
    
    The Makefile creates a shared DLL (libkondo.so) and static lib (libkondo.a)
        in the main directory, which you can use in your programs. 

2. USAGE

    Most of the function documentation is in the comments in libkondo.c
    There are also some usage examples in the utils directory,
    And a demo of using the wiimote to remote-control the rcb4 in "wii"
    And Java bindings (using SWIG) example in "java"
    And Python bindings (using SWIG) example in "python"
    And serial (termios API) examples in "serial"
