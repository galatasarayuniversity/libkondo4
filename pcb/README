1. MANIFEST

   This directory contains PCB drawings and schematics, in EAGLE format,
   for Kondo ICS 3.0 adapters.
   
   usb2kondo: USB 2.0 to ICS 3.0 adapter. Similar to the ICS USB adapter
      offered by Kondo, but has multiple ports. 
       
   ftdi2kondo: Provides a socket adapter for a FT4232H mini-module
      which provides 4-channel serial; channels C and D are connected
      to independent half-duplex ICS 3.0 circuits, and channels A and B
      are broken out so that you can use them for other purposes.
